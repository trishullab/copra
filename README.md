# copra
COPRA: An in-COntext PRoof Agent which uses LLMs like GPTs to prove theorems in formal languages.

# Setup Steps:
## Quick Setup for Lean 4:
1. Install itp-interface using the following command: (Our package is available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/copra-theorem-prover/)
```bash
pip install copra-theorem-prover
```

2. Run the following command to prepare the REPL for Lean 4. (The default version is 4.7.0-rc2. You can change the version by setting the `LEAN_VERSION` environment variable. If no version is set, then 4.7.0-rc2 is used.)
>NOTE: The Lean 4 version must match the version of the Lean 4 project you are working with.
```bash
export LEAN_VERSION="4.15.0"
install-lean-repl
```

3. Run the following command to build the REPL for Lean 4. Make sure that `lean --version` returns the correct version before running the command below. If not then check if `$HOME/.elan/bin` is in your path. Recommended to run `source $HOME/.elan/env` before running the command below.
```bash
install-itp-interface
```

>NOTE: These steps are only tested on Linux. For Windows, you can use WSL. These steps will not setup the Coq interface.

## Python 3.14t Setup (Free-threaded Python - Optional):
ðŸ†• **NEW:** COPRA now supports Python 3.14+ with free-threaded (GIL-free) support for improved performance!

1. **Create a Conda environment with Python 3.14t (free-threaded):**
```bash
# Create environment with free-threaded Python 3.14
conda create -n py314-ft python=3.14 python-freethreading -c conda-forge

# Activate the environment
conda activate py314-ft

# Verify Python version and free-threading support
python --version  # Should show Python 3.14.x
```

2. **Install COPRA theorem prover:**
```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install copra-theorem-prover

# OR for development, install from source
pip install -e .
```

3. **Run experiments with Python 3.14t:**
```bash
# Use run.py which automatically detects Python 3.14+ and uses Hydra-free mode
python -m copra.main.run --config-name lean4_simple_experiment

# Or if installed from source
python src/copra/main/run.py --config-name lean4_simple_experiment
```

> **Note:** Python 3.14t is experimental. Some packages may show compatibility warnings (especially Pydantic and OpenAI), but COPRA has been refactored to work with Python 3.14t's forkserver multiprocessing mode.

## Full Setup for Coq and Lean:
1. Install OCaml first. Use the instructions here: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html. Note that OCaml officially only supports Linux installations. One can use WSL on Windows machines.

2. Run the following to install Coq on Linux.
```
sudo apt install build-essential unzip bubblewrap
sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
```

3. Add the following to your `.bashrc` file: (sometimes the path `~/.opam/default` might not exist, so use the directory with version number present in the `~/.opam` directory)
```
export PATH="/home/$USER/.opam/default/bin:$PATH"
```

4. Create a `Miniconda` environment and activate it.

5. Run the commands for installing the Lean 4 interface as mentioned in [Quick Setup for Lean 4](#quick-setup-for-lean-4).

6. Add the following to your `.bashrc` file for Lean:
```
export PATH="/home/$USER/.elan/bin:$PATH"
```

## Setting up OpenAI API and Running Experiments:
1. You need to create a file `.secrets/openai_key.json` in the root directory of the project with the OpenAI API key. The file should contain the following:
```
{
    "organization": "<your-organization-id>",
    "api_key": "<your-api-key>"
}
```

2. The experiments are not necessarily thread safe. So, it is recommended to run them sequentially. The commands to run the desired experiments can be found in the file `./src/copra/main/config/experiments.yaml`.

3. Run the following command to run the experiments:

**For Python 3.14+ (with free-threaded support):**
```bash
python src/copra/main/run.py --config-name lean4_simple_experiment
# This uses a Hydra-free implementation compatible with Python 3.14+
# You can change the config name to run different experiments
```

**For Python < 3.14:**
```bash
python src/copra/main/eval_benchmark.py
# This will run the experiments mentioned in the file `./src/copra/main/config/experiments.yaml`.
# Change the file path in the command above to run other experiments.
```

**Universal command (auto-detects Python version):**
```bash
python src/copra/main/run.py --config-name lean4_simple_experiment
# This automatically uses Hydra-free mode for Python 3.14+ and Hydra mode for older versions
```

> **Note:** `run.py` is the recommended entry point for all Python versions. It automatically detects your Python version and uses the appropriate implementation (Hydra-free for 3.14+, standard Hydra for older versions).

## Important Note:
The ITP projects must be built before running COPRA. Make sure that the switch is set correctly while running it for Coq projects because the Coq projects can be using different versions of Coq.
