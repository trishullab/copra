[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
At which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect? Give your answer as an ordered pair in the form $(x, y).$ Show that it is (1,1).
[INFORMAL-PROOFS]
We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get $$x=3-2(2x-1)=3-4x+2.$$ Moving the variable terms to the left-hand side and the constants to the right-hand side, we find $$x+4x=5.$$ This gives $x=1$ which we may plug into either equation to get $y$. For example, $$y=2(1)-1=1.$$ So the lines intersect at the point $(1,1)$.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
Show that if $n$ is an integer less than 398, and $7 * n$ modulo 398 is 1, then $n$ must be 57. 
[INFORMAL-PROOFS]
Since 7 is coprime to 398, it has a unique inverse modulo 398. One can compute that $57 * 7$ is 1 modulo 398, hence the unique inverse must be 57.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
The sequence $S_1, S_2, S_3, \\cdots, S_{10}$ has the property that every term beginning with the third is the sum of the previous two.  That is, $S_n = S_{n-2} + S_{n-1} \\text{ for } n \\ge 3. $ Suppose that $S_9 = 110$ and $S_7 = 42$.  What is $S_5$?$ Show that it is $16$.
[INFORMAL-PROOFS]
We have $S_9 = 110$, $S_7 = 42$. We have $S_8 = S_9 - S_ 7 = 110 - 42 = 68$. Thus $S_6 = S_8 - S_7 = 68 - 42 = 26$. From this we get $S_5 = S_7 - S_6 = 42 - 26 = 16$. Therefore, the answer is $16$.

[INFORMAL-THEOREM] Show that for any natural number n, 3 divides $n^3 + 2n$.
[INFORMAL-PROOFS] We induct on $n$. If $n = 0$, then $n^3 + 2n = 0$ which is divisibe by 3. Assume that for a natural number $d$ that 3 divides $d^3 + 2d$. We will show 3 divides $(d+1)^3 + 2(d+1)$. We have $(d+1)^3 + 2(d+1) = d^3 + 3d^2 + 5d + 3 = d^3 + 2d + 3*(d^2 + d + 1)$. Since 3 divides $d^3 + 2d$ by the inductive hypothesis, and clearly 3 divides $3*(d^2 + d + 1)$, we have that 3 divides $(d+1)^3 + 2(d+1)$, and the argument by induction is complete.
